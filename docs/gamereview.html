                <p>Mega Man 4 is an action platformer dating back to the early 90s, when the Nintendo Entertainment System game console was in its prime. the Mega Man series of games have been developed by Capcom since the late 1980s, and have still been receiving entries in the series every couple years since then! i'll be reviewing Mega Man 4 because it's my favorite of the early entries in the series, partially due to the new mechanics it introduced to the series, but also in part due to the layers of story it added to the series.</p>
                <p>being an older game, there aren't many settings you can adjust to fit your preferred playstyle---lots of early video games were confined to the controls laid out on the controller as developers intended. however, the default control scheme is comfortable in my opinion, and follows suit with many other platformer games of the time, with movement on the D-pad and jumping/shooting/selecting options on the face buttons.</p>

                    <div class="flex-item"><figure><img src="images/Game-Review/cutsceneIntro.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the opening cutscene"><figcaption>In the year 20XX...</figcaption></figure></div>
                </div>
                <p>the premise of Mega Man is that, in the year 20XX, evil scientist Dr. Wily has his sights on world domination by hacking former colleague Dr. Light's occupational robots to turn them into weapons of destruction. Dr. Light transforms his household robot, Rock, into the heroic fighting robot Mega Man in order to foil Dr. Wily's plans for world domination.</p>
                <p>Mega Man must defeat eight of Wily's robot masters and then fight Wily himself at the end of the game in order to put an end to his plans. but in Mega Man 4, Wily has taken Russian scientist Dr. Cossack's daughter Kalinka captive, ordering Dr. Cossack to fulfill Wily's evil plans or else. Mega Man must save Kalinka and bring her back to Dr. Cossack's citadel so Cossack can relieve control of the robot masters, allowing Mega Man to fight Wily head-on.</p>
                <p>this game has several more characters than previous entries! to assist in understanding the character dynamics and roles, i've constructed a Kumu network that graphs each character's role in the story:</p>

                <p>after you start the game, you're met with a screen displaying each of Wily's eight robot masters. you can choose any of them to battle first, which gives the game a substantial amount of replayability---sometimes it's fun to take a path through the game you haven't tried before!</p>
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div class="flex-item"><figure><img src="images/Game-Review/gameplayStageselect.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the stage select"><figcaption>the stage select screen. i normally start with Toad Man!</figcaption></figure></div>
                </div>
                <p>once you select a robot master, you'll be transported to their stage. you must first traverse their stage and all the obstacles within it before you can battle the robot master. stages are filled with tight platforming, tough enemies and puzzles that will make you strategize your traversal of each room.</p>
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div class="flex-item"><figure><img src="images/Game-Review/gameplayToadman.jpg" alt="a screenshot of Toad Man's stage"><figcaption>in Toad Man's stage, the heavy rain will push you back, making jumps over wide gaps very difficult!</figcaption></figure></div>
                </div>                
                <p>you control Mega Man by running and jumping through each stage, but are also equipped with his Mega Buster, an energy gun with unlimited ammo that is used to take out enemy robots along the way. your Mega Buster is fairly weak, but after you defeat a Robot Master, you'll obtain their weapon---for example, by defeating Toad Man, i'll obtain his Acid Rain weapon which will cause a wide shower of heavy rain that damages other enemies. the weapons you obtain from Robot Masters do have limited ammo, but this energy is restored between stages and can also be restored with weapon energy pickups throughout stages.</p>
                <p>one of the fun parts of Mega Man series is that the weapons you obtain are weaknesses of other Robot Masters, so it's fun to discover the most optimal path of weaknesses to each Robot Master as you play through the game! it's like a very elaborate game of rock, paper, scissors.<p>
                <p>this game is very difficult compared to other platformers---the tight movement you have to perform for some sections requires precise input and practice, and lots of familiarity with the controls. however, with a soundtrack as great as this game's, and with very satisfying visuals to match it, it's enjoyable to get better at the game over time and be rewarded for your perseverance.</p>

                </div>                
                <p>one of the additions in Mega Man 4 that makes me enjoy the game even more than the others is that his default Mega Buster was upgraded in this game---by holding the Shoot button, you can charge a more powerful shot, which is able to pierce through most enemies and also deals more damage. it takes about two seconds to fully charge, but is very helpful when traversing stages or fighting tough bosses!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>i've grown up with the Mega Man series so finding an opportunity to write about it is always fun. this series is one of Capcom's longest running, and for good reason---it established a formula with platformers that is very recognizable, and its consistent quality has made it a series that stands the test of time. you can play Mega Man games on consoles as old as the Nintendo Entertainment System or as recent as the Nintendo Switch---the games are still being made today! i think everyone should give one of the entries in the series a try, to experience the wonderful soundtrack and design and to understand one of the exemplary series that has had massive influence on the platformer genre.</p>
