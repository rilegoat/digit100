                <h1>reflective essay</h1>
                <p>For this unit of our course, we developed a personal website with content to represent ourselves as well as a page that serves as a resume. We first learned to code the website using HTML and CSS using the code editor oXygen & the hosting service GitHub pages, and then we remade our website using the templating service Wordpress. By developing on both platforms, we learned about the differences in development workflow between working solely with code and working with a service that makes the process more visual.</p>
                <p><strong>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner?</strong></p>
                <p>When learning to design a website, you have to wrap your head around the idea of content being sectioned out into chunks. I use "chunks" as a very generic term here, because you can interpret that differently whether it's Wordpress' insertable plugins or templates, or whether it's the predefined tags and page structure of HTML. It can be difficult to understand this concept, but once you do, it makes the web design process much smoother, because you can think in terms of the structure more easily.</p>
                <p><strong>What advantages do you associate with one method over the other?</strong></p>
                <p>In favor of Wordpress, those who have never learned an ounce of programming can get into designing a website just by following the on-screen prompts and tools. Wordpress is a primarily button-driven interface with tools that are drag'n'drop into the page, which makes it much easier for less technically apt individuals to make a website with.</p>
                <p>Because of this, though, styling on Wordpress is very limited to the themes and formatting that the templates give you (despite the embedded CSS editor.) In favor of raw code, you can get as creative with the styling as you need to. I personally enjoy the creativity and versatility that comes with writing raw code and CSS, so I preferred the GitHub pages half of this unit.</p>
                <p><strong>What challenges are there for modifying the layout and organization of each site?</strong></p>
                <p>With the raw code & GitHub pages, there is a big technical barrier and you have to learn the associations between HTML tags & structure and the CSS that is used to format them. Learning how to use things such as flex boxes can be daunting at first, but are necessary for having more organizational structures to work with.</p>
                <p>With Wordpress, you have to be patient in finding each tool you need. I found myself scouring the menus for tools to make images and content appear the way I wanted it to. Rather than it being a technical barrier like with raw code, it is more of a familiarity barrier & becoming comfortable with the way the tools are hidden on the site.</p>
                <p><strong>What skills are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format?</strong></p>
                <p>To develop a website, whether by raw code or by using a templating engine, you need to be able to work from a skeleton up, without focusing on the details too early. Websites, entirely unstylized, should still be able to be navigated without much issue. You have to go into developing a website knowing that it will not look pretty immediately, but that's okay, because your first goal is content.</p>
                <p><strong>What skills do you think you want to learn to improve on this website?</strong></p>
                <p>When it comes to the GitHub pages & raw code editing, I would like to be better with using page sections to make my websites more accessible. Accessibility is something I never worried about before, but after this unit, I understand the importance of it much more, so I have to be sure to keep an eye on how my pages are structured and how I use section tags to organize my sites better.</p>
