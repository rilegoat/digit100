                <h1>text analysis</h1>
                <p>for this corpus analysis assignment, i am going to be comparing the writing styles of a long-running youtube series i have been watching for nearly a decade---Cinemassacre's "The Angry Video Game Nerd." <span style="color: #FF0000">please be aware that these scripts contain LOTS of profanity and graphic imagery, and they are intended for an adult audience!</span></p>
                <p>The Angry Video Game Nerd is a Youtube series directed and written by James Rolfe of Cinemassacre, playing the role of his persona as the titular Angry Video Game Nerd, reviewing games that he considers incredibly poor quality for older video game consoles. typically his scripts are written with over-the-top graphic imagery & hyperbole and excessive profanity as a way to drive home his character's extreme vitriol for these games</p>
                <p>i'm interested to compare how the writing for these episodes has changed from the advent of his channel closer to 2008 compared to recent episodes after being acquired by sponsors & under new video content monitoring that Youtube has implemented in recent years, to see if profanity has decreased or certain structure patterns have changed over the years.</p>
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div class="flex-item"><figure><img src="images/season4wordcloud.png" alt="season 4 wordcloud"><figcaption>Wordcloud from Season 4</figcaption></figure></div>
                    <div class="flex-item"><figure><img src="images/season1415wordcloud.png" alt="season 14-15 wordcloud"><figcaption>Wordcloud from Seasons 14 and 15.</figcaption></figure></div>
                </div>
                <p>one minor observation is that there does seem to be a very slight decrease in how often profanity is used in the later seasons, which confirms my original hypothesis! you can see how much smaller the words are in the Season 14-15 image compared to Season 4.</p>
